# Reproducing Results for arXiv:2512.03526

This repository contains the source code and data used to reproduce the results and figures in **arXiv:2512.03526**.

The work proves the **stretched exponential scaling of parity-restricted energy gaps** in a **1D random transverse-field Ising model (RTIM)**. The numerical experiments consist of two main parts:

1. **Exact diagonalization of the single-particle Hamiltonian**  
   We use exact diagonalization of the single-particle Hamiltonian to obtain the excitation energies of free fermions, which are then mapped to the energy gaps of the Ising models. See, for example, Eq. (8) of *Physical Review B 106, 064204 (2022)* for details.  
   - Time complexity: $\Theta(L^3)$, where $L$ is the number of sites.  
   - Numerical precision: limited by dense SVD precision, approximately $10^{-13}$.

2. **Analytical upper bound on the parity-restricted energy gap**  
   We compute the upper bound on the parity-restricted energy gaps of 1D RTIMs derived in this work. See Supplemental Material, Part II, for details. The implementation is in `src/analytical_upperbound.py` (see in particular `src.analytical_upperbound.eps2_upper_bound`).  
   - Time complexity: $\Theta(L^2)$ or $\Theta(L^3)$, depending on the calculation mode of the function.  
   - Numerical precision: can reach approximately $10^{-150}$.
